\subsection{R.Q. 1 Testing Approximations}

\subsubsection{Approximation Knobs}

ILLIXR uses state-of-the-art components such as OpenVINS\cite{Geneva2020ICRA} for SLAM. We located approximation knobs in OpenVINS and consulted domain experts on which ones should be modified and tuned. These are given in
\todo{href, see comment in LaTeX source}.
% This doesn't work for some reason:
%\href{https://github.com/ILLIXR/open\_vins/blob/illixr-testing/ov_msckf/src/slam2.cpp\#L30}{\verb+ILLIXR/open_vins/ov\_msckf/src/slam2.cpp:create_params()+}

\todo{Debug why this table is not showing up}

\begin{table}
  % \centering
  {
    \caption{OpenVINS approximation knobs. See OpenVINS documentation for more details\cite{Geneva2020ICRA}.}
    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{r||lX}
      \textbf{Knob} & \textbf{Range} (most approx. first) & \textbf{Meaning} \\
      \hline\hline
      \verb+num_pts+ & 50--300 & \\
      \verb+use_rk4_integration+ & [false, true] & \\
      \verb+use_stereo+ & [false, true] & \\
      \verb+use_klt+ & [false, true] & \\
      \verb+downsample_camera+ & [true, false] & \\
      \verb+enable_async_reproj+ & [false, true] & queries a current pose and reprojects the frame just before display, making up for some latency in SLAM \\
    \end{tabularx}
  }
\end{table}

We can also enable/disable asynchronous reprojection (elsewhere in ILLIXR; outside of OpenVINS).

%The user's head pose can change appreciably between the time that rendering begins and the frame reaches display. Therefore, \underline{Asynchronous reprojection} shifts the frame within its bounding box after it has been rendered, but just before it is displayed. This takes more computational time but can render a more accurate frame.

The exact set of knobs is not so significant, as long as I have some useful ones, some useless ones, and they are orthogonal.

\subsubsection{Timing Infrastructure}

In order to test the approximations, I need to know how much time they are saving.
