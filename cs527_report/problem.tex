We wanted to build out a system \textit{in practice} not just in theory. Therefore, we built off of Illinois eXtended Reality System (ILLIXR): an open-source runtime for AR/VR applications \todo{cite ILLIXR}.

This project seeks to answer or partially answer three questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{R.Q. {\theenumi}}}]
\item How can we test SLAM approximations in ILIXR?
  % time
\item How can we test SLAM approximations in ILLIXR \textit{automatically}?
  % time, runner, and tester
\item How can we test SLAM approximations in ILLIXR \textit{automatically} and \textit{quickly}?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Due to time constriants, We only provide a partial implementation of this research question.
  \end{itemize}
  % time, runner, tester, and learning
\end{enumerate}
